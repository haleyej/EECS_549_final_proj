## How To Run 
There is a Jupyter Notebook in the home directory called demo.ipynb. This is where you can run the IR system. Just input a query and how many results you would like to see. 

## Data 
This project uses a <a href = "https://socialgrep.com/datasets/ten-million-reddit-answers">dataset</a> of 600,000 posts and over 10 million comments on <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/">r/askreddit.</a> Due to computational limitations, I only indexed 200,000 posts.
