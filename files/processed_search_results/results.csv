When making homemade apple pie, it‚Äôs important to choose apples with the right texture and flavor. The best apples for apple pie are crisp and firm, with an equal balance of sweetness and tartness. We love using the Granny Smith apple due to its tangy, tart flavor and its firm flesh that doesn‚Äôt break down in the oven.
The juicy, sweet, and firm Honeycrisp is also a great choice for homemade apple pie. (Make sure to stock up on this apple in the fall while it‚Äôs in season!) The Gala apple is a great option year-round, with a mildly sweet taste and a crisp texture that doesn‚Äôt get mealy in the oven. Prefer a softer apple pie with a natural sweetness? Choose Golden Delicious apples.
For the best apple pie possible, there‚Äôs just one variety of apples we‚Äôd avoid completely‚Äîthe Red Delicious. These apples may taste yummy on their own, but they lack the tartness that really enhances the rich apple flavor of an apple pie. They also break down in the oven and become mushy. How to Store Apple Pie We‚Äôd be surprised if you end up with any leftovers, but not to worry‚Äîyour extra homemade apple pie doesn‚Äôt have to go uneaten! To keep the pie fresh, allow it to cool for 2 hours after baking. Cover the entire pie with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and store it at room temperature for up to 2 days. Still have some left? Store it in the fridge for 2 additional days! When you‚Äôre ready for a slice, just heat it up in the microwave for a few seconds.
Want to store your baked apple pie for a longer time period? You can keep this sweet treat in the freezer for up to 4 months! Assemble and bake your easy apple pie as directed in the recipe and let it cool completely. Wrap your pie tightly with plastic wrap, seal it in a 2-gallon freezer storage bag and place it in the freezer. When you‚Äôre ready to eat the pie, unwrap it and let it thaw at room temperature for an hour. Stick it in the oven at 375¬∞F.

We love the sweet crumb topping on this Dutch Apple Pie! For an ultra-impressive presentation, we love assembling a two-crust pie with a lattice crust like in our Caramel Apple Pie. It features alternating strips of weaved dough on the top crust.
This classic apple pie recipe makes a basic two-crust pie, with fluted crimped edges and cut-out slits on the top crust.

apple pie recipe,https://www.recipetineats.com/apple-pie-recipe/,"My Perfect Apple Pie My cookbook ""Dinner"" now available! My perfect Apple Pie Of all the sweet pies out there, Apple Pie might just be the most iconic of them all. In America, it‚Äôs practically its own religion and talk about what exactly makes the perfect Apple Pie can get as prickly as politics. Well, let me weigh in and tell you about my idea of the perfect Apple Pie. My perfect pie is packed with a generous amount of apple filling that‚Äôs never mushy and never undercooked. There‚Äôs some spicing but it‚Äôs even-handed and doesn‚Äôt overwhelm. The filling is also not overly sweet and won‚Äôt leave you grasping for a glass of water. Then the pastry. All this cosy apple goodness is encased in a shell of irresistibly flaky, buttery shortcrust. It‚Äôs not chewy nor is it sad and soggy. And let‚Äôs not forget the base! Of course it‚Äôs got to be perfectly crispy ‚Äì no exceptions. That‚Äôs my vision of perfect Apple Pie. If that all sounds good to you, then dare I say this might become your perfect apple pie recipe too. I hope you enjoy this recipe for many years to come! Recipe credits ‚Äì Many thanks to my French pastry chef teacher Jennifer Pogmore and RecipeTin‚Äôs Chef JB for their assistance and expertise to bring my vision of the perfect Apple Pie to life. We did it!!! Where so many Apple Pie recipes go wrong I don‚Äôt normally write so bluntly. But this is a very long post so I don‚Äôt have time for measured politeness! My recipe for perfect Apple Pie is really borne of all the things I have disliked about other Apple Pie recipes I have tried over the years, which I wanted to address. Here‚Äôs my biggest gripes: Reading back over my list, you must think I‚Äôm a bit of a whiny, difficult-to-please person. üòÇ It‚Äôs not that at all! People in my life know very well I am far from a hoity-toity type. For me, the thing about Apple Pie is that it‚Äôs not a quick recipe especially when you take the time to make the crust from scratch. So the end result needs to be worth the effort, ie. flawless! The other thing ‚Äì and this is the clincher ‚Äì is that pretty much all of the issues I listed above boil down to how the filling is dealt with. A filling made with raw apples for instance is a very common approach but leads to all sorts of problems like those I mentioned. If we can just fix the filling, we‚Äôre laughing. The solution: Bake the apples The solution to my gripes turned out to be simple: Bake the apples. It‚Äôs as easy as that. Here‚Äôs why it works: Here‚Äôs the proof! And here‚Äôs photo evidence of the difference baking the apples makes: What you need to make Apple Pie filling Here‚Äôs what you need to make the Apple Pie filling. (PS. The egg is out of place, it‚Äôs for brushing the pastry!). Apple Pie crust The classic crust used for apple pie is shortcrust and that‚Äôs what I use. My recipe is very standard (flour, butter, salt, sugar, water). However the one thing I should probably address is the debate over butter vs vegetable shortening. Advocates of vegetable shortening (which is a type of fat made from vegetable oil) love how it makes shortcrust pastry ultra-crumbly and flaky. I have no issues with vegetable shortening per se, except that it is tasteless. So while shortcrust pastry made with butter may not be quite as flaky, it is still flaky enough to me and more importantly, is a whole lot tastier to eat. And if your mind is going straight to ‚Äúwhy not use a combination‚Äù?, you must think like me because I tried that too. But I just found it still lacked flavour even using a 50/50 mix. So, all-butter shortcrust it is! Recipe here. PS. Also ‚Äì I use a food processor. Because I have hot little hands which melt the little bits of butter as I work with the dough. Food processor = exactly the same results as handmade + superior flakiness + SPEEDIER.

Ready to see how to make my Apple Pie?? Let‚Äôs do this! Game plan: My Apple Pie workflow 1. Prepare the pie crust 2. Blind bake the crust Blind baking (par baking) is key to ensure the crust is not just crispy, but also fully cooked. We tried numerous variations without blind baking the crust. The results were mixed. For some, the base was soggy, and for other attempts, either the base and or/sides were not fully cooked. Conclusion: blind baking is essential! Here‚Äôs how to do it. 3. Baking apple slices Baking the apple slices is the key step for the Perfect Apple Pie. Read the reasons why in the section above! 4. Fill the pie OK! We‚Äôre on the home stretch here to the best part: cooking but more importantly, EATING IT!!! 5. Lattice tutorial! OK!

I promise it‚Äôs not hard! 6. Bake it! Here‚Äôs a close up of the cut apple pie after it‚Äôs rested overnight and has been reheated in the oven. It‚Äôs still nice and juicy, and cuts neatly.

apple pie recipe,https://kristineskitchenblog.com/my-favorite-apple-pie/,"Apple Pie Recipe Best Apples for Apple Pie The best apple pie starts with good baking apples. You want to use apples that are firm enough to hold up to the heat of baking, so that they don‚Äôt cook down into mush. I like to use a combination of sweet and tart apples in apple pie for the best flavor and texture. My favorite is a combination of Granny Smith and Honeycrisp apples. The Granny Smiths add tartness, and the Honeycrisps are on the sweeter side, so you get the perfect balance of sweet and tart flavors. Perfect Pie Crust Another key to the best apple pie is a buttery, flaky pie crust. We‚Äôll be using my easy all-butter Pie Crust Recipe ‚Äì you don‚Äôt have to chill the dough before rolling it out, and it rolls out like a dream. The trick to the best flaky pie crust is to use very cold butter and ice-cold water, and to work quickly to keep the butter cold. But don‚Äôt stress! You really can‚Äôt mess up this pie crust. I like to make pie dough in my food processor, because it is quick and easy. You can also make the pie crust by hand, using a pastry blender. The steps to making the pie crust are simple: How to Make Apple Pie Here‚Äôs an overview of the simple steps to making this apple pie. Or, jump straight to the full apple pie recipe. How to Make a Lattice Pie Crust A lattice-top pie crust is the name for the woven crust that you see on the top of this apple pie. It‚Äôs fun and pretty to make a lattice top crust for your pie. To make a lattice pie crust, roll out the dough for the top of the pie into a 12-inch diameter circle. Use a sharp knife, pizza cutter or pastry wheel to cut the dough circle into ¬Ω-inch strips. Using every other strip from the circle, arrange half of the dough strips going one direction across the pie. Leave a little bit of space in between each strip. Weave the other half of the dough strips through the first set, over and under, pulling back the first set of strips as needed to weave. I find it easiest to start in the center of the pie when weaving, and pull back every other of the first set of dough strips. Once you finish weaving in strips on one side of the pie, begin weaving the remaining strips of dough on the other side of the pie. When you are finished weaving, trim off any excess dough from around the edges of the pie. Fold the edges under and crimp or flute as desired. This apple pie from scratch is one of our very favorite apple recipes. It‚Äôs especially delicious served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Give this recipe a try and then leave a comment below to let me know how it turned out! Make Ahead Instructions If you want to make this apple pie ahead for your Christmas or holiday meal, I recommend baking it the day before, letting it cool completely, and then storing it at room temperature, wrapped tightly with plastic wrap. To make two days ahead, cool completely, wrap tightly, and store in the refrigerator. Take the pie out of the refrigerator 1-2 hours before serving to let it come to room temperature. To store apple pie: You can store your apple pie at room temperature for one day. This apple pie can be stored in the refrigerator for 4-5 days. To freeze apple pie: Let the pie cool completely and then wrap it tightly. Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw for 24 hours in the refrigerator before serving.

The first step is to peel and slice your apples. You want the apple slices to be about 1/4-inch thick. You will need about 8 cups of sliced apples (6-8 apples) to fill a deep dish pie dish. Place the sliced apples in a large bowl. To the bowl, add the rest of the apple pie filling ingredients: Stir to combine the ingredients. Then you‚Äôll let the filling sit at room temperature while you make the pie crust. As the filling rests, the sugar will start to bring out the juices from the apples. You‚Äôll stir the filling again after it sits to make sure everything is well combined. Assemble the Pie The pie crust recipe makes enough dough for a top and bottom pie crust. You‚Äôll cut the dough in half and shape it into two disks. Refrigerate one disk for the top crust, and roll out the other for the bottom crust. Fit the bottom crust into your pie dish so it reaches all the way up the sides of the dish. Give the apple filling a stir and transfer it to the bottom crust in the pie dish. If it seems like your apples won‚Äôt fit, use your fingers to arrange them a bit and help them better fill the space. Roll out the second pie crust for the top of the pie. You can place it on the pie whole, you can make a lattice pie crust (see below for step by step photos), or you can use a cookie cutter and arrange the dough shapes on top of the pie filling. If placing the dough round on the pie whole, be sure to cut a few slits in the top dough so that steam can escape as the pie bakes. Lightly brush the top crust with milk or an egg wash. This helps the crust to brown nicely. (I usually use milk instead of an egg wash, which is a combination of an egg and milk or water, because I find it easier and just as effective). While your oven preheats, chill the pie in your refrigerator to make sure the crust is cold. You‚Äôll bake your apple pie for 20 minutes at 400¬∞ F and then another 40-50 minutes at 350¬∞ F. Check on the pie after it has baked for about 30-40 minutes total, and cover it loosely with foil to prevent the crust from browning too much. The pie is done when the filling is bubbly.
